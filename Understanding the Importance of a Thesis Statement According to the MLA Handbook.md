## What Is a Thesis Statement?

A **thesis statement** is a clear and specific argument or claim that your paper will support and explore. It is typically one to two sentences long and appears at the end of your introduction. It serves as a roadmap for the reader, providing them with a preview of what to expect in the body of your paper.

The **MLA Handbook** explains that your thesis statement should not only be clear and concise but also debatable. A strong thesis takes a position that someone could potentially disagree with, and it guides the rest of your essay by focusing your research and arguments.

Your thesis statement is the backbone of your essay or research paper. It helps to maintain focus, providing structure and clarity to your writing. Without a well-defined thesis, your paper might lack direction and coherence. According to the _MLA Handbook_, a weak or unclear thesis statement can leave your readers confused and unsure of your argument.
